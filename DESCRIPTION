Description: Provides functions for creating 3D radial visualizations of multivariate data.
    The package extends traditional radial coordinate visualization (RadViz) techniques
    to three-dimensional space, enabling enhanced exploration and analysis of
    high-dimensional datasets through interactive 3D plots.
